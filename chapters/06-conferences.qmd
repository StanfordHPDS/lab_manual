# Conferences

Conferences provide an opportunity to learn about new research, get feedback on your own research, practice presentation skills, take a short course, network, and more. Dr. Rose is happy to discuss conferences relevant to your research and career goals in our meetings.

If we have discussed a conference and Dr. Rose is funding your trip, please send Dr. Rose a projected budget for the trip *before* purchasing plane tickets, registrations, or reserving hotels. 

Lab members can view our internal list of upcoming conference presentations [here](https://github.com/StanfordHPDS/conferences).

## Stanford Travel Policies

Flights for Lab trainees and staff **must** be purchased through Stanford Travel. They are not reimbursable otherwise. Hotels **must** be purchased through Stanford Travel unless it is a conference hotel. Please copy Dr. Rose on travel-related emails with administrative staff.

**Health Policy and Biomedical Data Science Students**: If you are presenting at a conference, submit for up to $1,000 of those expenses to be reimbursed through the [Biosciences Travel Grant Program](https://oge.stanford.edu/financial/travel-grant-program/). You are eligible for one conference per year.
