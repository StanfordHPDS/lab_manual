# Publications
by Sherri Rose

## Authorship

We aim to discuss authorship early in the research process and have continuing conversations regarding team member roles. Plans can change and contributions may evolve over time. If you have authorship questions during the process of working on a project, we want you to feel empowered to ask these questions! **It is an expectation in the Lab that no new authors are invited to join an existing Lab project (i.e., where Dr. Rose is the lead PI) without the prior agreement of, at a minimum, Dr. Rose and the first author(s).** The Lab follows the [ICMJE recommendations](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) regarding who is included as an author.

## Journals

The journal lists below are not exhaustive and largely focus on outlets where Lab members have previously published their work. Decisions about where to submit manuscripts for publication are made collaboratively to balance the needs and priorities of the team with as much deference as possible to what is best for the trainee author(s).
