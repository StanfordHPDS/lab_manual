## Bringing Data to Stanford

The key steps in bringing a new data set to Stanford include completing submitting an IRB and a data risk assessment review.

### Data Risk Assessment

The [data risk assessment (DRA) review](https://uit.stanford.edu/security/dra) process at Stanford must be followed to bring external data to Stanford. A summary of this process is included below. However, the DRA review process is subject to change and should be confirmed and followed as described on the DRA website.

- Review the [Stanford Risk Classifications](https://uit.stanford.edu/guide/riskclassifications) to determine the level of risk of your requested data.
- If the requested data are high risk, then you will need to submit a [DRA](https://uit.stanford.edu/security/dra). If you are not sure if the data are high risk, there is also a pre-screening form that helps assess whether a DRA form is necessary.
- In the DRA form, you will need the following information: 
  - Project information
    - Project leader contact information
    - IRB information (if applicable)
    - Funding source 
    - Any other relevant parties involved in the project (e.g., Stanford Health Care)
    - Any other individuals who will be involved with the data 
  - Who are you getting the data from? (third party) 
    - Contact information (e.g., name and email address)
    - Data flow diagram
    - Are the data going in or out of the U.S.?
  - Brief description of the project and reason for needing this data source 
  - Brief description of the data source 
    - Elements (e.g., lab results, diagnoses or procedures) 
    - Number of records
    - Data dictionary (if available) 
    - Data source (e.g., institutions and individuals involved in producing the data)
    - Whether the data are identified or de-identified and how are the data de-identified? (e.g., Safe Harbor method)
- Await the DRA review. You may get follow-up questions from the University Privacy Office, such as:
  - How do you plan to store the data? 
  - Will Stanford data be used or shared? 
  - Will data be shared back with the third party?

### Datasets

We are in the process of bringing the [Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study (CRIC)](https://repository.niddk.nih.gov/studies/cric/) from NIDDK to Stanford.

## Data Sharing {#sec-data}

Many of our studies involve secondary analyses of existing health databases. It is typically not permitted for us to share such data due to privacy considerations. Thus, we often created simulated data that has some similar properties to the health databases to share along with our code and published results.

## Simulated Data

Many of our projects involve simulating data to test our methodology under situations where we know the underlying truth and because we cannot share certain health data due to privacy considerations. Simulating data is an important skill to learn.

Examples of detailed simulation studies designed by Lab alums include work from [Irina Degtiar](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.13863) and [Anna Zink](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.13206).

*Note: Creating simulated data is different than designing a microsimulation study. It can be confusing!*
