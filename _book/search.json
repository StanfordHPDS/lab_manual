Meetings are either 25 minutes or 50 minutes to allow for breaks between meetings. Dr. Rose expects trainees to manage the meeting such that it ends on time.\nIn general, Dr. Rose expects progress to be made between each meeting. Progress can include struggling with the material. Dr. Rose cares that you are engaged and taking initiative to advance the project. We’ll discuss what you learned and where you are still confused. When we identify areas where you have gaps, Dr. Rose does expect you to invest in learning the required material and to follow through to fill those gaps. All trainees must be making satisfactory academic progress in line with the expectations of their graduate degree program.\nIf you do not need to meet a particular week (e.g., making steady progress and don’t have questions, busy preparing for an exam and did not work on research that week, etc), please email Dr. Rose in advance so she can efficiently reallocate the meeting time. Your physical and mental health are important. If you need to cancel a meeting for health or personal reasons, email Dr. Rose. As much notice as is possible is helpful, but it is always better to cancel a meeting short notice than to attend when you are sick!\nIf there are repeated meeting cancellations, we should discuss the underlying reasons.\nPlease also see Section 2.3 for details on recurring meeting agendas.",

A summary of this process is included below. However, the DRA review process is subject to change and should be confirmed and followed as described on the DRA website.\n\nReview the Stanford Risk Classifications to determine the level of risk of your requested data.\nIf the requested data are high risk, then you will need to submit a DRA. If you are not sure if the data are high risk, there is also a pre-screening form that helps assess whether a DRA form is necessary.\nIn the DRA form, you will need the following information:\n\nProject information\n\nProject leader contact information\nIRB information (if applicable)\nFunding source\nAny other relevant parties involved in the project (e.g., Stanford Health Care)\nAny other individuals who will be involved with the data\n\nWho are you getting the data from?

(e.g., Safe Harbor method)\n\n\nAwait the DRA review. You may get follow-up questions from the University Privacy Office, such as:\n\nHow do you plan to store the data?\nWill Stanford data be used or shared?\nWill data be shared back with the third party?\n\n\nLab experts on the DRA process include Marika Cusick.\n\n\n4.3.2 Datasets\nWe are in the process of bringing the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study (CRIC) from NIDDK to Stanford.",
