# Stanford Lab Manual

The [Health Policy Data Science Lab](http://healthpolicydatascience.org/) at Stanford is a group of interdisciplinary researchers who develop and apply quantitative methods to solve problems in health policy, leveraging techniques from statistics, computer science, economics, epidemiology, and decision science.

This manual will evolve over time to incorporate contributions from Lab members and collaborators. We drew inspiration from the lab manuals of our colleagues, including [Jade Benjamin-Chung](https://jadebc.github.io/lab-manual/index.html) and [Russ Poldrack](https://poldracklab.org/labguide/).

Feel free to draw from this manual (and please cite it if you do)!
