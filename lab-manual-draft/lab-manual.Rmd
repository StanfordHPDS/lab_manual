# Stanford Lab Manual

The [Health Policy Data Science Lab](http://healthpolicydatascience.org/) at Stanford is a group of interdisciplinary researchers who develop and apply quantitative methods to solve problems in health policy, leveraging techniques from statistics, computer science, economics, epidemiology, and decision science.

This manual will evolve over time to incorporate contributions from Lab members and collaborators. We drew inspiration from the lab manuals of our colleagues, including [Jade Benjamin-Chung](https://jadebc.github.io/lab-manual/index.html) and [Russ Poldrack](https://poldracklab.org/labguide/).

Feel free to draw from this manual (and please cite it if you do)!

# Lab Culture
by Sherri Rose

The culture of the Health Policy Data Science Lab is inquisitive, collaborative, kind, and inclusive so that scholars can do their best work. Our group has high standards for rigor, quality, and ethics and helps each other learn to reach these objectives. Every team member is a human first, and their career goals will be centered and supported.  We are committed to an environment that is free from discrimination and harassment.

## Mutual Respect in the Lab

We strive for a culture of mutual respect in all of our communications, meetings, and policies. Please demonstrate respect for all Lab members by, for example, practicing active listening, speaking only for yourself and not others, and not dominating conversations. Mutual respect for each other's time includes being prepared (including drafting agendas), planning ahead, and starting/ending meetings at the scheduled time.

## Respect for the People Represented in Study Data

A key value in the Lab is deep respect for the people and communities whose information is represented in the data we study. We engage seriously in learning about the policies, institutional structures, societal biases, and lived experiences that underlie these data sources.

This respect also involves careful attention to data privacy and protection, discussed in Section \@ref(data).

## Working Hours

Lab members are encouraged to work efficiently and effectively on a schedule that works well for them. **We do not support a culture of overwork!** 

Dr. Rose does not expect you to be working in the evenings or on weekends and asks that you respect Lab members' evening and weekend time as well. This includes not expecting Dr. Rose to review your work product, submit letters, or otherwise be available for typical work tasks outside business hours.

We embrace time off, breaks from meetings, and vacations!

## Trainee Support, Access, and Accomodations

Your physical and mental health are incredibly important. Please familiarize yourself with the [mental health](https://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/mental-health-resources-stanford) and [crisis assistance](https://glo.stanford.edu/glo-services/crisis-assistance) resources available for students at Stanford as well as mental [health resources](https://postdocbenefits.stanford.edu/my-benefits/medical-coverage/mental-health-resources) for postdoctoral scholars.

Stanford is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for disabled students. Disabled students are a valued and essential part of the Stanford community. If you experience disability, please register with the [Office of Accessible Education (OAE)](https://oae.stanford.edu/). Professional staff at OAE will evaluate your needs, support appropriate and reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Academic Accommodation Letter for faculty. If you already have an Academic Accommodation Letter, Stanford invites you to share your letter with your advisor. Academic Accommodation Letters should be shared at the earliest possible opportunity so we may partner with you and OAE to identify any barriers to access and inclusion that might be encountered in your experience.



<!--chapter:end:01-culture.Rmd-->

# General Policies
by Sherri Rose

It is important that each trainee and Dr. Rose have a shared understanding of expectations regarding research in the Lab and academic progress in the trainee's degree or postdoctoral program. The policies in this chapter aim to aid in this goal.

## Joining the Lab

Dr. Rose keeps a page updated [on her website](http://drsherrirose.org/new-students-and-postdocs) regarding whether she is taking new students, hiring postdocs, or available for dissertation committees. At Stanford, we've had students from many different graduate programs join the lab, including health policy, biomedical data science, computer science, and chemical engineering programs. 

## Recurring Meetings

Lab trainees meet individually with Dr. Rose regularly. This is typically weekly or every other week depending on the needs of the trainee and their projects. Meetings are either 25 minutes or 50 minutes to allow for breaks between meetings. Dr. Rose expects trainees to manage the meeting such that it ends on time.

In general, Dr. Rose expects progress to be made between each meeting. Progress can include struggling with the material. Dr. Rose cares that you are engaged and taking initiative to advance the project. We’ll discuss what you learned and where you are still confused. When we identify areas where you have gaps, Dr. Rose does expect you to invest in learning the required material and to follow through to fill those gaps. All trainees must be making satisfactory academic progress in line with the expectations of their graduate degree program.

If you do not need to meet a particular week (e.g., making steady progress and don't have questions, busy preparing for an exam and did not work on research that week, etc), please email Dr. Rose in advance so she can efficiently reallocate the meeting time. Your physical and mental health are important. If you need to cancel a meeting for health or personal reasons, email Dr. Rose. As much notice as is possible is helpful, but it is always better to cancel a meeting short notice than to attend when you are sick!

If there are repeated meeting cancellations, we should discuss the underlying reasons.

Please also see the below Section \@ref(meeting-agendas) for details on recurring meeting agendas.

## Meeting Agendas

Trainees must prepare an agenda prior to each recurring meeting with Dr. Rose. Create a google doc (invite Dr. Rose as editor) that you’ll add to in reverse chronological order for each meeting with the information below included. Update the google doc by 11AM *one business day* before our meeting. Repeatedly not creating agendas will result in cancelled meetings.

**[Meeting Date]**

- What has been completed since previous meeting:
- Topics to discuss at the meeting:
- What will be completed by the next meeting:

## Individual Development Plans 

If Dr. Rose is your primary advisor, students and postdoctoral scholars should complete the Stanford Individual Development Plan (IDP) when joining the Lab and then annually thereafter ([student forms](https://oge.stanford.edu/academics/idp/forms/), [initial form for postdocs](https://postdocs.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/opa_idp-initial_0.pdf), [annual form for postdocs](https://postdocs.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/opa_idp-annual_0.pdf)). This applies regardless of home department. Trainees should plan to check in on progress made toward IDP goals once a quarter. Dr. Rose expects that trainees will be responsible for scheduling the annual IDP meetings and adding the IDP check-ins once a quarter to the agenda for an existing recurring meeting.

## Academic Progress in Graduate Degree Programs

If you are a graduate student and Dr. Rose is your primary advisor, please create and regularly update a shared document that includes major degree requirements (e.g., coursework, teaching, qualifying exams, etc) and completion status (e.g., completed, planned completion date). Include links at the top to the graduate degree handbook from your home department as well as key contacts in your home department who should be kept apprised of your academic progress. This document will be discussed quarterly along with the IDP check-ins, and students should add it to the agenda for an existing recurring meeting.

## Registering for Units

Graduate students should discuss their plans to register for research units with Dr. Rose each term (often BIOMEDIN 299 or HRP 399). Units should be taken credit/no credit and not for a letter grade. Permission codes are currently required to register for research units. 

## Deadlines

We aim to set ambitious yet feasible target deadlines for work product in a collaborative process. It is often the case that research takes longer than we expect, and an internal agreed-upon deadline is no longer possible. If you anticipate missing a deadline, contact Dr. Rose. It is an expectation in the Lab that all members are proactive about discussing revised deadlines rather than waiting until after the deadline has passed. If a trainee is repeatedly missing deadlines, we should discuss the underlying reasons.

## Lab Meetings & Events

The Lab holds Lab Meetings and various types of events throughout the year, including lunches, data jamborees, coffee chats, and journal clubs. If you have ideas for events, suggestions are always welcome.

Food at Lab events is funded by the Lab and free to Lab attendees. We expect that trainees who RSVP and submit food orders will show up to the event, barring illness or personal situation. If you need to change your RSVP, please contact Dr. Rose to help us avoid food waste.

## Communication

We have a Lab **slack**. Lab members can search for "HPDS Lab" in the [Workspaces at Stanford](https://stanford.enterprise.slack.com/) and request to join.

Please keep in mind our Lab philosophy on working hours in Section \@ref(working-hours). Do not assume that because you have sent a slack message or email that you should get an instant reply.

## Bringing Data to Stanford

The key steps in bringing a new data set to Stanford include completing submitting an IRB and a data risk assessment review.

### Data Risk Assessment

The [data risk assessment (DRA) review](https://uit.stanford.edu/security/dra) process at Stanford must be followed to bring external data to Stanford. A summary of this process is included below. However, the DRA review process is subject to change and should be confirmed and followed as described on the DRA website.

- Review the [Stanford Risk Classifications](https://uit.stanford.edu/guide/riskclassifications) to determine the level of risk of your requested data.
- If the requested data are high risk, then you will need to submit a [DRA](https://uit.stanford.edu/security/dra). If you are not sure if the data are high risk, there is also a pre-screening form that helps assess whether a DRA form is necessary.
- In the DRA form, you will need the following information: 
  - Project information
    - Project leader contact information
    - IRB information (if applicable)
    - Funding source 
    - Any other relevant parties involved in the project (e.g., Stanford Health Care)
    - Any other individuals who will be involved with the data 
  - Who are you getting the data from? (third party) 
    - Contact information (e.g., name and email address)
    - Data flow diagram
    - Are the data going in or out of the U.S.?
  - Brief description of the project and reason for needing this data source 
  - Brief description of the data source 
    - Elements (e.g., lab results, diagnoses or procedures) 
    - Number of records
    - Data dictionary (if available) 
    - Data source (e.g., institutions and individuals involved in producing the data)
    - Whether the data are identified or de-identified and how are the data de-identified? (e.g., Safe Harbor method)
- Await the DRA review. You may get follow-up questions from the University Privacy Office, such as:
  - How do you plan to store the data? 
  - Will Stanford data be used or shared? 
  - Will data be shared back with the third party? 



Lab experts on the DRA process include Marika Cusick.

### Datasets

We are in the process of bringing the [Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study (CRIC)](https://repository.niddk.nih.gov/studies/cric/) from NIDDK to Stanford.

## OMOP

## Data Sharing

Many of our studies involve secondary analyses of existing health databases. It is typically not permitted for us to share such data due to privacy considerations. Thus, we often created simulated data that has some similar properties to the health databases to share along with our code and published results.

## Simulated Data

Many of our projects involve simulating data to test our methodology under situations where we know the underlying truth and because we cannot share certain health data due to privacy considerations. Simulating data is an important skill to learn.

Examples of detailed simulation studies designed by Lab alums include work from [Irina Degtiar](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.13863) and [Anna Zink](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.13206).

*Note: Creating simulated data is different than designing a microsimulation study. It can be confusing!*

# Publications
by Sherri Rose

## Authorship

We aim to discuss authorship early in the research process and have continuing conversations regarding team member roles. Plans can change and contributions may evolve over time. If you have authorship questions during the process of working on a project, we want you to feel empowered to ask these questions! **It is an expectation in the Lab that no new authors are invited to join an existing Lab project (i.e., where Dr. Rose is the lead PI) without the prior agreement of, at a minimum, Dr. Rose and the first author(s).** The Lab follows the [ICMJE recommendations](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) regarding who is included as an author.


## Preprints
